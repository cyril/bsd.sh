# BSDanywhere Project Development Policies
#

Subversion Organisation
=======================

trunk/
    The main development line. Tested code. Always builds.
    Always generates a working image.

branches/
    Developers' branch. For testing, playing around and
    brave innovation. Can build. May contain untested code.

releases/
    Twice a year trunk gets copied into releases/XX. No development.


Development Guidelines
======================

- Everybody should make sure to merge back from their branch into trunk by
  using small diffs. Don't play for months and commit one huge diff.
- Make sure trunk/ always builds and generates a proper image.
  No reason to be shy about commiting into trunk. As long as everything
  builds fine, no problem. ;)
- Develop on a Unix-alike system. Files containing CRs will be backed out.
- Avoid Perl or other high level languages whenever possible. Always use
  shell code (ksh) or make in the build scripts, instead.
- All commitments must be licensed under a BSD/ISC alike license.
- All commits are emailed to bsdanywhere-source@googlegroups.com.
- Help, questions or answers should go to bsdanywhere@googlegroups.com.
- Do not add code or features that prevent people from trying or using
  OpenBSD. We do not compete with the OpenBSD project and don't want to
  cut into their CD sales.
- BSDanywhere ISO images must not exceed 736970752 bytes.
